## 🧪 Lab Exercises

Each lab file includes:
- **Business context** — why this function matters in a real team
- **Acceptance criteria** — what "done" looks like
- **Team standards** — type hints, docstrings, input validation, edge cases, and tests

### Day 1 Labs (`lab_starter_Day1.py`)
| # | Exercise | Concepts |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | `validate_customer_email` | Input normalization, domain allowlists |
| 2 | `calculate_compound_interest` | Financial calculations, input validation |
| 3 | `load_csv_records` | File I/O, error handling |
| 4 | `fetch_api_json` | HTTP requests, timeouts, safe error messages |
| 5 | `mask_pii` | Data privacy, dictionary immutability |
| 6 | Unit Tests | pytest, happy paths, edge cases |

### Day 2 Labs (`Day2.py`)
| # | Exercise | Concepts |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | `stream_csv_records` | Memory-efficient generators, chunked streaming |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) enabled in your IDE
- VS Code (recommended) with the GitHub Copilot extension

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
cd dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
./start.sh
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Running Lab Tests

```bash
cd 6AprilOnwardsTraining/PythonCodes
pytest test_day2.py -v
```

## 📋 Team Coding Standards

All exercises follow these enterprise standards — the same ones Copilot should be prompted to respect:

1. ✅ Add **type hints** to all function signatures
2. ✅ Add **concise docstrings** with parameters and return values
3. ✅ **Validate inputs** and raise meaningful exceptions
4. ✅ Handle **edge cases** explicitly
5. ✅ Keep functions **small and readable**
6. ✅ Prefer the **standard library** unless there's a clear reason not to
7. ✅ Write tests for both **success and failure** scenarios
